# Abstract-class-of-shapes

A Console App (.NET Framework) that: Makes use of an abstract class called Shape which represents one single shape Creates an object hierarchy to include additional classes for:
        Rectangle
        Square
        Box
        Cube
        Ellipse
        Circle
        Cylinder
        Sphere
        Triangle
        Tetrahedron 
Prompts the user via a menu to create an instance of one of your shapes ses polymorphism to store shapes into a list Continues to prompt until the user selects the exit option Displays a neat, orderly table of all instantiated shapes, their dimensions, areas and, in the case of three-dimensional shapes, their volumes
     
     The main class  should have the following features:
        A list to store shapes of any kind
        Error checking for user input
        The Main( ) method should be highly modularized
